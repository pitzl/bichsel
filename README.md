## energy loss in silicon

Hans Bichsel: Straggling in thin silicon detectors

The original code was in FORTRAN and may still be found at  
https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~sudong/silicon/

Here, the code is transformed into Fortran 90: bichsel.f90

It produces a table of the differential energy loss cross section
("delta rays") in silicon for a given incident particle, using
tables of dielectric 'constants' and generalized oscillator strengths.

It also produces an energy loss distribution ("Landau") for a
silicon sensor of given thickness by convolution.

Some .C code is added for plotting the cross section table with ROOT.

The original calculation extends from 1.7 eV to 1.3 MeV, which leads
to an overflow peak for high energy particles.
The cross section tables can be extended manually with extend.C,
using the pure Rutherford 1/E^2 cross section and maintainig the same
logarithmically equidistant energy binning.

Instead by convolution, an energy loss disribution may also be
generated by Monte Carlo simulation of many particle tracks: simdelta.cc
